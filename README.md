Despite the vital importance that mental health plays in our well-being, it is often disregarded, ignored, and scarcely discussed among individuals. This alarming situation has been found to have exacerbated especially since the Covid-19 pandemic, and many studies have expressed concern about the effect that the pandemic has had on various aspects of our lives. Recent research has suggested that alongside the impact of the disease itself, the essential social distancing measures have also played an unfortunately important role in the increased levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness.  

Recognized as a form of a mental illness, anxiety is defined by the NHS as "a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe". Anxiety disorders are the most common of mental disorders and affect nearly 30% of adults at some point in their lives. Previous studies have suggested that there is a rise of use social media use when individuals feel anxious and distressed. And it has become clear that this use of social media can provide researchers with a better understanding of the seeking and sharing nature of humans, and more importantly play a vital part in the process of diagnosing and assisting people with anxiety.

For this purpose, I have decided to analyze the text data gathered from anxiety threads on Reddit, and classify the posts that infer anxiety. The dataset has been vectorized through both BERT and TF-IDF, with the latter being used for the Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Gaussian Bayes, XGBoost, GBM, and Adaboost models.
